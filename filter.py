Problem: 
Many signals are given
BUT, only a few can be selected to have a reasonable amount
of stocks in the portfolio

Objective is to know:

In the CONTEXT of my trend reversal strategy,
1. can I know when is the best time to leave a position.
2. How can I enhance the selection of those stocks to have a reduced batch of choices, 
and a globally better batch
3. The holding period should be max 15 days.
